 <strong>Dear friend</strong>
 <p>
Hey Friend I hope you are doing well. I am writing this letter to you to tell you that I miss you a lot i am sorry for annoying you. I know that I have been annoying you a lot lately it's just that it's my love language and i can't stop it and i try every day to stop but i'm not able to stop it.
i keep making you angry and mad because of it and i'm sorry for that. I know that you are a very good friend and you don't deserve to be treated like that i'm verry sorry about it and i really hate it when i make you mad and angry.
it's just that i love you too much that i can't stop being myself and i cant't stop annoying you.
i hope you can understand me.
i promise i'll try to stop annoying you and i'll try to be a better friend to you.
</p>
